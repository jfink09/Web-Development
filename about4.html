        <b>Our Mission</b> is to get more undergraduate students involved in research.

        Undergraduate research opens many doors for students' futures. Students involved in undergraduate research
        have the opportunitiy to be creative, solve new problems,<br> make new discoveries, and contribute

    <p class="more">
        <b>QuestUni</b> was founded in 2020 by three Penn State students in the College of Engineering who wanted to improve the structure of how 
        students can learn about and become <b>connected to undergraduate research</b>. The main way that QuestUni wants to accomplish this is
        throught a different approach than most universities - by providing students with an online platform where they may be helped with 
        their search for research opportunities based on their <b>interests and career goals</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is <b>no real structure</b> students can use to find a research opportunity. Typically, students have to do a lot of searching, write many 
        emails, and try to talk with many professors to even see what exists at their university. If a professor does not go to a student in class and 
        ask if they are interested in research, looking for a project or a lab can bring great friction. No matter how much a student knows about
        faculty's research, they may not even get a response from them by email. There needs to be <b>an easier way</b> for students to learn about research and 
        the opportunities that exist at their university, and there needs to be an easier way for students to be connected to research through a <b>structured</b>
        process tailored to themselve. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Students tend to have a wide variety of topics about which they are passionate that often deviates outside the boundaries of 
        their major, and therefore their department. This causes many students to find it difficult to be exposed to all of the research 
        opportunities at their school. QuestUni developed a <b>research form</b> that retrieves pertinent information about the student and their
        interests and goals. The goal for this is to show students as many different research projects and labs in which they may be interested 
        in collaborating and show students opportunities based on their responses that is offered at their school with respect to research. 
        When students use this form, they will <b>find projects</b> that suit their interests and skills <b>faster than before</b>, and find other undergraduate, 
        graduate or faculty working on a given project as a team with whom the student may network. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To achieve our goals, QuestUni is proactive in developing useful <b>research content</b> that students can view on a daily basis
        to <b>improve research awareness</b>, what is possible through research, and <b>tips on how to find research</b>. QuestUni posts interviews
        with students who are involved in research and professional scientists, engineers, and physicians who became successful through
        performing research. When students collaborate and innovate at their school, they discover, learn and gain experience to help 
        progress their community and the world further. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is only the beginning. As QuestUni expands its features and users, it also expands more opportunities for students to <b>network, collaborate, and 
        become more involved</b> with their peers and school. QuestUni continues to try and <b>bridge any gaps</b> in the ability for students to become their 
        best selves before they graduate and go on to lead their careers. The future we want, is a future where students find what drives them to do amazing things 
        in their careers and a future that maximizes the opportunities for students to get involved in things that motivate them while in their college careers.

    <p class="stats-subsubheader">
        Many students think undergraduate research is only for students with the intention
        of attending graduate school or an internship is more useful. QuestUni helps reduce 
        this misconception by generating content about what can be accomplished by performing 
        undergraduate research.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="stats-subsubsubheader">
        A Data Buddies survey of 9,610 college students was done to understand why such a small amount of students participate in research. The largest 
        reasons were due to thinking internships are more important, or not knowing the opportunities exist.
